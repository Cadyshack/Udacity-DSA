# Problem 6: Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

The task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. For example, the union of A = [1, 2] and B = [3, 4] is [1, 2, 3, 4].

The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all objects that are members of both sets A and B. For example, the intersection of A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [2, 3, 4] is [2, 3].

The code can take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively.
