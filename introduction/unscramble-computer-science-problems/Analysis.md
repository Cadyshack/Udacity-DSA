## Task0
**Description**: The problem involves calculating the sum of all elements in an integer array.

**Approach**: Iterated through the array a single time, summing each element.

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Algorithm**: A single loop runs through each element of the array once.
- **Big O Notation**: $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.
- **Justification**: Each element is accessed once; hence, the time complexity is directly proportional to the array size.
